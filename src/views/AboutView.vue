      <p>
        I'm a software developer with two dogs who loves hiking and nature. I started building websites in 2010 with a passion for blogging and designing my own online spaces. Over the years, that passion has grown into a career creating small utility software products and games.
      </p>
      <p>
        I build and share my projects under the name <strong>Yellow Umbrella</strong>, a tiny indie software studio focused on joyful, helpful digital tools.
